## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. 🧠 Set up Lex bot and intents
2. 🛜 Deploy API Gateway using Swagger
3. 🔗 Connect LF0 Lambda to API
4. 💬 Deploy LF1 for Lex fulfillment
5. 📦 Run Yelp scraper and upload to DynamoDB + Elasticsearch
6. 📥 Configure LF2 to poll SQS and send emails
7. 📅 Schedule LF2 via EventBridge
8. 🌍 Upload frontend to S3 bucket and test live

## 🚀 Deployment Overview

### 1. Frontend Hosting
- Static site hosted via **Amazon S3**
- Uses Bootstrap and the API Gateway SDK for chat integration

### 2. Amazon Lex Chatbot
- **GreetingIntent**: Welcomes the user
- **ThankYouIntent**: Responds politely
- **DiningSuggestionsIntent**: Collects:
  - Location
  - Cuisine
  - Date
  - Time
  - Number of people
  - Phone/Email

- Uses **LF1 Lambda hook** to validate and push user input to **SQS Queue (Q1)**

### 3. API Gateway + LF0 Lambda
- Acts as an API wrapper between frontend and Lex
- Enables CORS
- Uses Swagger for definition

### 4. Data Collection & Storage
- Yelp scraping using `yelp_fetch.py`
- Store data in:
  - **DynamoDB (yelp-restaurants)** for full info
  - **Elasticsearch** for indexed search

### 5. Email Suggestions via LF2 Lambda
- Triggered by EventBridge (every minute)
- Pulls from SQS → fetches from Elasticsearch → joins with DynamoDB → sends via SES
